# dwave-leap
Site for Leap code testing and development, documentation, and research.
This repository will be use to create code for work with D-Wave Systems Leap system and to make available, on 
a monthly basis, any code that is created using Leap.  This will allow for satisfying the D-Wave Leap requirement of
making available one repository with an original project each month in order to gain access to D-Wave Free Developer Access.
